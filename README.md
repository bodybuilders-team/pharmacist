## Architecture üèóÔ∏è

### Backend

The backend code is located in the [`src/backend`](./src/backend) directory.

The backend is a **REST API** built using **[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)** and
**[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)**. It is responsible for managing the data and the business logic of the
application.

It's implemented following the **layered architecture** pattern, with the following layers:

- **HTTP**: responsible for handling the HTTP requests and responses, and the HTTP pipeline.
- **Service**: responsible for the business logic of the application.
- **Repository**: responsible for managing the data.

For simplicity, the backend uses an **in-memory database** to store the data. This means that the data is not persisted
between runs of the application. A future improvement could be to use a **relational database** to store the data.

### Frontend

The frontend code is located in the [`src/frontend`](./src/frontend) directory.

The frontend is a **mobile application** for **Android** built using **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)** and
**[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose)**. It is
responsible for providing a user interface for the application.

The frontend code is organized as follows:

- [Domain](src/frontend/app/src/main/kotlin/pt/ulisboa/ist/pharmacist/domain): contains the domain models of the
  application.
- [Service](src/frontend/app/src/main/kotlin/pt/ulisboa/ist/pharmacist/service): contains the service classes that
  interact with the backend.
- [Session](src/frontend/app/src/main/kotlin/pt/ulisboa/ist/pharmacist/session): contains the session classes that
  manage the user session.
- [UI](src/frontend/app/src/main/kotlin/pt/ulisboa/ist/pharmacist/ui): contains the UI components of the application.
    - [Screens](src/frontend/app/src/main/kotlin/pt/ulisboa/ist/pharmacist/ui/screens): contains the screens of the
      application, where each screen is implemented using a:
        - **<ScreenName>Screen.kt**: the screen composable.
        - **<ScreenName>ViewModel.kt**: the view model of the screen, responsible for managing the screen's state.
        - **<ScreenName>Activity.kt**: the activity that hosts the screen.

## How to Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone
```

2. Run the **Docker Compose** command in the `src/backend` directory to start the server:

```bash
cd src/backend
docker-compose up
```

3. Open the frontend project in **Android Studio** and run the application on an **Android Emulator** or a **Physical
   Device**.
